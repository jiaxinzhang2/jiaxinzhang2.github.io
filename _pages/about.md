I am expanding into **AI**, with a focus on **large language models** and **AI for mathematics**.

My research background lies at the intersection of **probability theory** and **partial differential equations (PDEs)**.

During my Ph.D., I developed a theory for multiple SLE systems — a class of random multi-curve systems — and analyzed their deterministic limits, using methods from probability theory and quantum field theory. For background, see the [introductory slides by Fields medalist Stanislav Smirnov](https://www.unige.ch/~smirnov/slides/index.html).

Previously, I also studied **equilibria in nonlinear diffusion and nonlocal interaction**, focusing on the structure of energy minimizers and connections to optimal transport theory. For an accessible introduction, see the  [introductory lectures by Caltech applied math professor Franca Hoffmann](https://mm.math.cmu.edu/recordings/cna/franca_hoffmann_small.mp4).
