* I am a sixth-year graduate student from mathematics department, Caltech, where I am advised by Professor [Nikolai Makarov](https://pma.caltech.edu/people/nikolai-makarov). 
Before my doctoral studies, I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Peking University.
   Here is my [CV](https://jiaxinzhang2.github.io/assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

* My research involves analysis, probability theory, and mathematical physics. To be more precise, I am interested in the theory of Schramm-Loewner evolutions (SLE) and its connections to mathematical conformal field theory (CFT).
