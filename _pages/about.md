Thesis
======
[On multiple SLE systems and their deterministic limits](https://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechTHESIS:05202025-052235420), Ph. D. thesis, California Institute of Technology, 2025.

I work at the intersection of analysis, probability theory, and machine learning. With a background in stochastic processes and optimization, I am now expanding into artificial intelligence.
